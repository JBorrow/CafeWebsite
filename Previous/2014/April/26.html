	<h1> An impromptu book-related cafe... </h1> <br> <h3>26 April 2014</h3>
	<p>
This Café Scientifique is going to be a bit different than all the others - there will be no formal talk and discussion, just a pair of activities for all to get involved in with little prior preparation/knowledge! There will be the opportunity to swap and talk about books and their role in society and science, however, science discussion is not necessary at this Café!
</p><p>
There are two main parts to this 'Book Café':
</p><p>
1. BOOK SWAP: Bring books that you don't want any more (or that you have read 
more than 5 times and really don't need to read again) and give them to others! 
We will have a dedicated table where we will put them all and then everybody can
 have a look to see whether they want to take home something different 
 (science-related and non-science-related both welcomed).
</p><p>
2. TALK ABOUT A BOOK YOU LOVED/ENJOYED/HATED... The main activity in this Cafe 
will be a series of presentations given by YOU! Bring a book that... - you found 
really interesting, - is your favourite, - got you interested in something, - 
you absolutely abhorred... and tell us WHY within 3 min! If you don't have the 
book you would prefer to present with you in Durham, then bring its ghost and
 present it anyway. It does not have to be about science and the genre can be 
 literally anything: Sci&Fi, children books, Adventure, Biographies, trashy 
 Romance (get excited for Marie's talk on a romance!), textbooks, 
 encyclopedias....
</p><p>
"So what if", I hear you asking, "I never really liked books and couldn't 
bring/present anything?" No problem! As usual there is no obligation to 
take part in any of the activities. Come anyway and listen to what the others 
like. Or tell us about all the books you were forced to read at school.
</p><p>
We look forward to meeting you with or without books attached in Empty Shop HQ for a drink and a natter!
