	<h1> Waves, solitons and science education</h1> <br> <h3>08 February 2014</h3>
	<p>
Solitons are waves of a very special sort - they persist for a surprisingly long time, neither breaking nor dispersing, as do typical waves on water for example. Nowadays their properties are the subject of intensive study by mathematicians and physicists but they were first discovered in the 1830’s by a Scottish engineer riding his horse by the Edinburgh Glasgow canal. This talk will explain some of this story with the aid of a couple of practical demonstrations.
</p><p>
Café Scientifique this week will host an interactive talk on solitons by Patrick Dorey from the Mathematics department at Durham. Using his experience in teaching (and your craftsmanship) we will be building our VERY OWN SOLITON in the Gala Theatre Cafe.
</p><p>
It will be a great example of how to engage in communicating mathematical concepts. Following from this, we will be partaking in another activity, the aim of which is to come up with new science-education ideas of our own. 
</p><p>
No previous knowledge of science required as always! We hope you will come along to enjoy a drink with us at the Gala Theatre Café, for what's sure to be an engaging cafe!
