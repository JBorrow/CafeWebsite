	<h1> Science history and science today</h1> <br> <h3>15 February 2014</h3>
	<p>
For this Café Scientifique, John and Jamal will host two engaging and inclusive science activities that investigate the greatest moments in science, in terms of both the history of science discoveries and the science that occurs today. Both activities will be very interactive and informal, and will allow two teams to compare and contrast ideas - and debate the logic behind them!
</p><p>
The first activity will reflect on the greatest moments in science history (including those that come from engineering, technology and mathematics) that have had the greatest influence on our work today. The ideas from this activity come from research by John, Jamal and you all! Send John or myself a message or post a comment on this event if you have a suggestion for one of the greatest moments in science.
</p><p>
In the second activity, we're going to hear a bit about some burning topics from all areas of science that scientists are working on today - again, including suggestions from all the Café-goers. What we're looking for is a short description (e.g. a paragraph) of a lab, research group or scientists' area of interest you like from any field of science and why you think it is important or compelling to research. What research groups do you find inspiring enough that they will bring about some of the future greatest scientific moments? With these in mind, we're then going to brainstorm as a group to decide which we would fund (with a set amount of money) and why. This will follow a friendly debate with the second group.
</p><p>
We hope you will come along to enjoy a drink with us at the Gala Theatre Café, for what's sure to be engaging activities!
