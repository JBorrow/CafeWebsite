	<h1> The dark side of the Universe, and cosmology </h1> <br> <h3>01 February 2014</h3>
	
<p>There's more to our Universe than meets the eye - a lot more. Most of what’s out there still has scientists in the dark. Astronomical observations have established that everyday matter accounts for only 5% of the cosmos. The rest is invisible to our telescopes. It seems that darkness rules. But what is this dark stuff? How do we know it’s there? And what does it do? This Café will explore the depths of space: touching upon dark matter, dark energy and the Big Bang.
</p><p>
At this week's Café Scientifique, we will finally go to the stars, with our first cosmology talk by Pete Edwards, Director of Science Outreach at Durham University, who specialises in physics. We're very happy to host such an experienced science communicator, and I know there'll be plenty of things I, and other people at the Café will want to learn from his approach. Following this, we have an interactive activity where we'll be putting together a pool of ideas for how best to spread scientific knowledge, understanding, and inspiration to the general public.

We hope you will come along to enjoy a drink with us at the Gala Theatre Café, for what's sure to be an engaging talk and activity!</p>
