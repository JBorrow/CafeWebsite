	<h1> The lens' eye view of ageing </h1> <br> <h3>22 February 2014</h3>
	<p>
In this week's Café Scientifique we will be going to the <strong>Jumping Bean Cafe</strong> for a talk by Roy Quinlan on ageing through the lens of the eye.
</p><p>
Tracking the ageing process in individuals is difficult. Cell and protein turnover make this a challenging science and we are often only left with the pathologies of ageing rather than a log of the cause and development of that pathology. Few tissues retain their original proteins and fewer still keep those that are damaged. Hair is an example where previous abuses linger, but that record is easily clipped short! The eye lens is a tissue where that log is complete, but to decipher that information and indeed to even know of its existence, there have been some pretty remarkable human endeavours and not all of them were used for the good of our world. This discussion therefore has the subtext of "hope" through the ingenuity of human kind.
</p><p>
In this week’s activity we will be discussing the role of belief in science, from how science can convince us that certain statements are true, to how it affects the hopes and progress of the discipline and the scientists who practise it. It will be a great opportunity to discuss science through the eyes of any field and as usual, no previous knowledge is required!
