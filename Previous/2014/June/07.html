	<h1> Connecting Mathematics, Neuroscience and Biology. </h1> <br> <h3>07 June 2014</h3>
	
<p>
This week at Caf√© Scientifique we will be having a talk by Emma Coutts from the maths department who will be discussing computational neuroscience which is a broad and fascinating topic that links neuroscience with many other areas of research such as mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science. Using tools from all of these (and more) disciplines, computational neuroscience hopes to understand the workings of the brain from its smallest structures to that of higher cognitive functions and even diseases/disorders of the brain.
</p><p>
This talk aims to introduce the topic by exploring the history of the area, from the grizzly experiments of early neuroscience to the modern day, computational, Blue Brain project.
</p><p>
Afterwards there will be discussing the implications of this kind of research. <strong>As always no previous knowledge is required and everyone is welcome!</strong>
