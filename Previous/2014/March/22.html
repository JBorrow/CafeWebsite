	<h1> Protein dynamics and the social impact of research </h1> <br> <h3>22 March 2014</h3>
	<p>
At this week's Café Scientifique, our last before a month hiatus, Vladas Oleinikovas from Cambridge university will talk about protein dynamics in a test tube and in computers. The speaker will share his passion for protein dynamics and his experience working in different fields using different approaches: protein NMR, computer simulations and single molecule fluorescence techniques.
</p><p>
Vladas will also tell his personal story about how his past experiences in Chemistry, Structural and Computational Biology, and Biophysics led to choosing his career path thus far. The following September Vladas will start a PhD in Molecular Dynamics at UCL. Using atomistic simulation and enhanced sampling techniques, Vladas will develop methods to systematically evaluate protein druggability.
</p><p>
In the second part of the Café, we will have a discussion on the social impact of scientific research from the perspective of social cohesion, health, environment, public policy and cultural understanding. We will do this by examining different research done by various 'Russell Group' universities in the UK, who's aim for greater social impact drives a lot of their research, including a revolutionary music education device (Skoog), food chilling technologies, carbon-negative construction (buildings that absorb carbon!), maps of medicine, the cost/economy of nature and lighting technology and dancing in the streets and discussing the usefulness of each.

Hope to see you all in Empty Shop HQ for another great afternoon of sciencing!</p>
