	<h1> The frontiers of cancer treatment</h1> <br> <h3>15 March 2014</h3>
	
<p>In Saturday's talk, James Swinscoe, a radiotherapist from the University of Sheffield, will give a talk on research in the treatment of cancer, how it has advanced in the past 10 years and its fundamental importance for the future. This will encompass on overview of the equipment used in the treatment of cancer, some of the techniques employed as well as the use of medical trials in advancing this area of science.

After the talk, we will have a discussion examining funding in the NHS. This will both include how to generate money for the service as well as how to prioritize certain projects and programs. People are free to participate or simply listen, and there'll be lots of interesting scientific and societal points discussed.
