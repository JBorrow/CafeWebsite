	<h1> Psychobiology of stress and nutrition</h1> <br> <h3>01 March 2014</h3>
	<p>VENUE: EMPTY SHOP, next to the Gates shopping centre.
</p><p>
This week our stressful talk will highlight what is known about psychobiological
 stress reactivity from laboratory and naturalistic studies. Stress reactivity is
 a set of overlapping behavioral and endocrine (related to hormone production)
 indicators of stress. There is still much debate on the stress reactivity systems
 in humans. It will then be considered whether current models of stress reactivity
 may need to be re-conceptualised on the basis of studies which have investigated 
psychobiological stress reactivity in the ‘real world’, such as in sky-diving studies!
 Michael Smith from Northumbria University will talk about these factors and remove
 some of the mystique regarding the complex and crucial phenomena to our everyday
 and scientific lives.
</p><p>
In the second half, we will put together a unique activity which explores
 Michael's other area of research: nutrition, and the activity will look at
 the representation of nutrition in the news (e.g. eating cereal/omega 3 fish 
pills will make you smart!) and try to debunk some of the myths therein, with 
some help from our speaker and Neuromythbusters.

We hope you all enjoy our first café at Empty Shop!</p>
