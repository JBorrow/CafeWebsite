	<h1> Schizophrenia, depression and evolution </h1> <br> <h3>08 March 2014</h3>
	<p>
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: Our new permanent location is now EMPTY SHOP on Framwellgate Bridge, Durham city centre! See us there this week for another cool psychology Café.
</p><p>
Hello everyone, this week will conclude our psychological fortnight with another Café about neuropsychological problems exploring two of the most talked about mental health conditions. This Café will be less discussion based than usual (but hopefully have a lot more depth as a result!), with two main 15 minute talks (with a 5 minute discussion following each) from two PhD students in Durham's psychology department: Yan Birch and Sophie Hodgetts. 
</p><p>
Yan will be talking about evolutionary psychopathology of depression. Can evolutionary theory help us understand depression? Medical approaches to depression and other psychological disorders often treat such conditions as purely pathological. Moreover, the medical approach often treats symptoms, but gives little consideration to the ultimate causes of such conditions. In this talk, Yan will present an alternative framework drawing on potential evolutionary explanations for psychological disorders, with specific reference to depression, which may help inform treatment and intervention.
</p><p>
Sophie will talk about estrogen as a protective factor against schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterised by various psychotic symptoms including hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder. The disorder is also associated with significant cognitive deficits. In particular, executive functions such as attention control, response inhibition and memory control are often impaired in patients with schizophrenia. Sophie's research aims to investigate the estrogen hypothesis of schizophrenia with respect to cognitive impairments. Specifically the aim to show that estrogen has a protective effect against these symptoms, as well as to investigate the potential mechanism of protective estrogen effects in the brain. This research will hopefully lead to a better understanding of the issues faced by patients with schizophrenia, and of the potential for estrogen as a treatment.

I know a lot of people will want to talk more to the two speakers and with each other about mental health issues, so I can confirm we can stay in Empty Shop for a while after. Come along for some friendly discussion after some great talks!
