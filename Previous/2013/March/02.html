	<h1> Journey to the Centre for Life </h1> <br> <h3>02 March 2013</h3>
	

      <p>As a response to Catherine and Rebecca's wonderful idea at a past Café, Café Scientifique and the Natural Sciences Society are instead of a Café hosting a 'Class Trip' to Newcastle titled 'The Journey to the Centre for Life' which actually coincides with our first anniversary, with the first Café Scientifique ever being a pilot in March.</p>
      <p>Why the Centre for Life (or Science at Life) is so cool, from the website:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Explore the Curiosity Zone - a 100% hands-on exhibition which encourages you to think creatively and act like a scientist.</li>
        <li>Experience our stunning planetarium - the biggest in the North of England.</li>
        <li>Join our inspiring Science Explainers doing demonstrations in the Science Theatre.</li>
        <li>Have the ride of your life on our 4D Motion Ride (minimum height requirement: 1.2m/4ft).</li>
        <li>Delve into our fabulous exhibitions including Human Life which explores where we came from and what the future could have in store for us."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I can assert that the planetarium is very impressive - it has an amazing video that delves into the human body and is impeccable for explaining biology concepts (aimed at children but still the clearest explanation I've seen!) and I personally loved the 'Remix Machine' when I went with Tim.</p>
      <p>Hard Details: We will meet OUTSIDE ESTABLISHMENT BAR at 1:45pm sharp to walk with anyone who wants to to the station or alternatively you can meet us at station. We're getting the 2:15pm replacement bus service (but you must buy a train ticket!) which will appear in the car park of the train station.</p>
      <p>Entry to the Centre for Life is £7.25 for students and £8.25 otherwise, but we can have group discount (10 for the price of 9) to make this lesser (by how much exactly we'll see by the numbers who come).</p>
      <p>We think this will be a massively fun experience that everyone will find engaging, and it'll be a great chance to get to know people outside of Establishment bar. See you there!</p>
