	<h1> How should we study animals? </h1> <br> <h3>09 March 2013</h3>
	

      <p>Hello everyone, Café Scientifique returns to Establishment bar to host a Café that has been planned for over half a year, one relating to the study of animals in academic science. This may sound very controversial, but in actuality it isn't really: study of animal could be anything from fascination of a dog's sense of smell, curiosity of birds calls, or comparing apes to humans in anatomy.</p>
      <p>The Café will begin with a roleplaying activity by which everyone will join a group of the research areas that interest them the most - for example, cognitive psychology, developmental biology or pharmacology. Then the group of 'scientists' will discuss with their labmates how best to undertake research into various areas, given options and provoked to weigh the pros and cons. This activity should allow us to experience first hand the difficult questions researchers must face with many external demands and perhaps create an understanding of why people may decide to use animals in their research.</p>
      <p>The second half will replace the talk with four short talks - each by a member of the Natural Sciences Society: Tim Wiles, Chas Nelson, Freya Varden and myself. We will each talk about a different facet of animal studies, each designed to convey information or dispel a myth that may have been perpetuated regarding the area, such as the difference in animal studies abroad, the history and improvement/discarding of certain techniques as well as modern initiatives to improve ethics.</p>
      <p>This Café will concern itself with the 'how's not the 'why's, merely allowing everyone concerned to come up with the ethics themselves after the main talks. We only seek here that people know what is currently going on in a modern scientific area. Please buy a drink from Establishment bar during this very atypical Café!</p>
