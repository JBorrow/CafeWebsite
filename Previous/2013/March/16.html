	<h1> The extraordinary science behind everyday objects </h1> <br> <h3>16 March 2013</h3>
	

      <p>This week Professor John Girkin, Director of the Biophysical Sciences Institute at Durham, will be talking on the links between basic science and industry. John spent several years in industry before coming back into academia and will be using his experience of both sectors in his talk.</p>
      <p>John will be introducing quite how much science and thought go into some really simple everyday objects. He will present a few examples, as well as some more abstract ideas, e.g. what happens to flames in zero gravity, before handing over to a group discussion looking at some seemingly simple commercial products: trust me, the level of thought and science in these is outstanding!</p>
      <p>As always, all are welcome and no previous knowledge is required! So why not pop down to Establishment, Durham City for the last Cafe Scientifique of the term!</p>
