	<h1> The Chemistry of Biological membranes </h1> <br> <h3>14 December 2013</h3>
	
<p>
For our last Caf√© Scientifique of 13, John Sanderson from the Durham University
 Chemistry Department will be talking to us about his research. John studies
 biological membranes of many different sorts, which are the boundaries that
 biology uses to separate its machinery from the outside world. He has designed
 components of these membranes that can give them interesting new properties,
 and made progress in the fight against viruses.
</p><p>
We hope you'll join us to find out more about his fascinating work so far, 
and what he plans to do in the future.
</p><p>
In our activity, we'll also be having some holiday fun as we play &quot;Explain
 like I'm Victorian&quot;, a game where we ponder how science has changed over
 the past 200 years. Top hats recommended but by no means necessary.
</p><p>
So come along to Chapters Cafe on Elvet Bridge for some good science and great fun.
