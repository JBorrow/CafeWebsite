	<h1> The Science of Teaching Science </h1> <br> <h3>07 December 2013</h3>
	

<p>In our first Café Scientifique at new temporary location of CHAPTERS CAFÉ, we will host a talk (with demonstrations) by Richard Hornby from the Institute of Physics on some theories behind what are the best ways to teach science to children.</p><p>Richard argues that we have a look at the nature of learning, and see how understanding the way we learn can help to develop learning activities both for the classroom and beyond. Following this, we'll be engaging in an activity where *we* have to design and enact an educational science activity.
</p><p>
This Café is perfect for anyone interested in education and science engagement. These are topics that concern everyone, and Café Scientifique is the perfect forum for such a discussion with its frequent thinkers from vastly diverse backgrounds - you guys!
</p><p>
Tim Wiles and others in yellow t-shirts will be meeting anyone who would prefer in market square at 3:55pm under the 'horse-statue'. If anyone wants to help him promoting the Café in town, give him a message!

Come take part in Chapters Of Durham Tea Rooms with a hot drink and some cool science!
