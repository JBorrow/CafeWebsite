	<h1> Depth perception and designing 3D sound</h1> <br> <h3>23 November 2013</h3>
	
<p>
Café Scientifique returns this week with speaker Jonathan Berry from the Computer Science department at Durham talking about depth perception and designing 3D systems using both auditory and visual information to create a 3D percept.
</p><p>
Although extensive research has been undertaken to develop and use 3D visual displays effectively, relatively little thought has been given to their integration with 3D (spatial) sound systems. Literature clearly shows that what we see and hear are interdependent, giving examples of some weird multi-sensory illusions. Can we use these illusions to enhance stereoscopic content for TV, gaming, cinema and virtual environments? We will review the psychology of multi-sensory illusion and depth perception, and the physics of cutting-edge 3D sound systems and visual displays, before presenting some novel experimentation demonstrating a possible computer application to integrated audio-visual 3D systems.
</p><p>
These issues will be explored both in a talk by Jonathan and a discussion that will look at the most compelling ways to integrate 3D into our life, whether everyday or something new entirely!
</p><p>
Come along to the café just to the left of the Gala front desk for some good drinks, great science and excellent company! As always, no previous knowledge of science is required and all are welcome!
