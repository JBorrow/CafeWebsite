	<h1> Stimulating voices: hallucinations and the brain </h1> <br> <h3>09 November 2013</h3>
	
<p>Peter Moseley from the Psychology Department will be talking about the neuroscience of hallucinations drawing upon his psychological and neurostimulation research on hearing voices. He will focus on the rising symptom-based approach to related disorders such as schizophrenia and show research that treats hearing voices as a separate entity to mental disorders.
</p><p>
A discussion by Peter, Jamal Kinsella and Jack Barton, president of Psychology Society, will look at neurostimulation in more detail, and examine how it can be used to treat disorders and 'improve cognition', as well as the media perception and its safety. How would you change your brain?
