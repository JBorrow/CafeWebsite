	<h1> Making the Coldest Stuff in the Universe and Explain-Like-I'm-Victorian </h1> <br> <h3>30 November 2013</h3>
	<p>
In our first Café Scientifique in our new temporary location, the Bishop's Mill (Wetherspoon's), we will host an exciting talk and discussion by physicist Arin Mizouri.
</p><p>
Where is the coldest stuff in the universe? It’s not on the moon, where the temperature plunges to a mere minus 228 Celsius. It’s not even in the deepest outer space, which has an estimated background temperature of about minus 270 degrees Celsius. In fact, the lowest temperatures ever attained are observed right here on earth! They are even closer to home than you might think, right here in the Physics labs at Durham University! We achieve such temperatures using lasers to cool atoms, in itself an incredible scientific accomplishment. Laser cooled atoms can be reacted to form cold molecules, but cold molecules can also be cooled by other means such as using magnetic traps to manipulate their motion. The study of cold atoms and molecules has led to uncharted territories of physics at large, from the study of chemistry in interstellar gas to quantum simulations. It has allowed us a passage into the wonderful world of quantum mechanics, a world where magic is a reality.

Following this, Tim will be running a fun roleplay activity that he titles 'Explain-Like-I'm-Victorian'. In the activity, we ask the question "What would a 19th-Century scientist make of today's technology?" Hopefully, Arin will support the playful mood with some physics demonstrations. This should be a engaging quirky activity and as always, no previous science knowledge is required!</p>
