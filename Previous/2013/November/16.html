	<h1> 'Eye and Lumiere' in Durham University</h1> <br> <h3>16 November 2013</h3>
	
<p>
Hello science enthusiasts, this week there will be no typical Café Scientifique event for two reasons a) the Lumiere will make the Gala area very tricky to get around and organise in and b) we wanted to encourage all scientifically interested people in coming to the Eye and Lumiere event at a similar time hosted by the Durham University Biophysical Science Institute. However, after the talks we're hoping to have a Café Scientifique discussion with some of the speakers in the University. All are welcome.
</p><p>
The lecture will be led by the artist behind the installation "I" (Gina Czarnecki) and will be a unique opportunity for members of the public to understand the eye from the perspectives of a physicist, biologist and psychologist. The talks are aimed at the general public and children above 12 years old. The lecture will coincide with the Saturday switch-on of the interactive video installation “I” which will be projected onto the Durham University Bill Bryson Library and will be influenced by the audience.
</p><p>
The location of the event is Calman Learning Centre (CLC). For those who don't know, Calman Learning Centre is on the Durham University 'Science Site', around 15 minutes from the town centre.

Because there are a number of things going on, I'm just going to write them in a rough timetable format:
</p><ul><li>
2:30pm - Refreshments</li><li>
3pm - The Physics of the Eye by Prof. John Girkin: This talk will introduce the physics behind the way the eye works such as the way in which the eye is specialised for different environmental conditions e.g. the retina has the ability to act as an array of optical fibres to maximise light sensitivity.</li><li>
3:20pm - The eye, vision and biology by Prof. Roy Quinlan: The eye in evolution will be discussed by comparison of the development of the eye in across a range of animals. A few of the medical conditions that can affect human vision will be introduced.</li><li>
3:40pm - Visual Perception by Dr Bob Kentridge: This talk will look at the way that the human brain interprets the information received by the eye. Recent research resulting from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be shown illustrating how brain damage due to illness or accidents can affect a person visual perception.</li><li>
4pm - Café Scientifique discussion in CLC Café!</li></ul>
<p>Hope to see many of you there!</p>
