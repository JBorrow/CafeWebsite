	<h1> Bacteria, antibiotic resistance &amp; bioethics </h1> <br> <h3>02 November 2013</h3>
	
<p>During this Café Scientifique, we will have two special bioscience guests from outside of Durham: Laura Makin from the University of Oxford and Janis Sliede from the University of Aberdeen, giving talks and hosting activities with us.
</p><p>
Laura will talk about the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Why do we need alternatives? She will also explain how the quorum sensing technique of studying bacteria and how quorum sensing inhibition suppresses bacteria and how this works biologically. She will explore examples of quorum sensing such as successful trials in mice for cholera and promise for Pseudomonas (a common bacteria that affects the lungs).
</p><p>
In our activities, Laura and Janis from Aberdeen will examine the Hippocratic Oath’s emphasis on saving life... what about substituting one life to save many? These are issues that medical bioscientists need to consider and we will aim to do so ourselves. We will also examine, from our discussion last week, the emphasis of free access to data... In H5N1 flu publication - is publishing potentially dangerous info ethical? Further we will consider issues of bioterrorism and public perception of science.
</p><p>
We hope you'll meet our interesting guests and make them feel at home in Durham! Come along to the café just to the left of the Gala front desk for some good drinks, great science and better company! As always, no previous knowledge of science is required and all are welcome!</p>
