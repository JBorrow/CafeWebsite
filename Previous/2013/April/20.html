	<h1> Predicting solar cycles </h1> <br> <h3>20 April 2013</h3>
	

      <p>Welcome back to Café Scientifique Durham City, we have some exciting Cafés planned for this series and we are starting with a strong one. The sunspot number is one of the longest physically observed time series, reflecting the waxing and waning of solar activity since the 17th Century. Its clear patterns combined with tantalising irregularity challenge modern science to predict what the Sun will do next. Anthony Yeates from Mathematics will introduce how scientists are attempting to make predictions, in an age where the imperative to do so is more important than ever before.</p>
      <p>With this Café, we hope to introduce an interesting and seldom thought about topic of the sun and how it influences us, and the discussion will explore how the sun affects other sciences including the use of solar power and the like, as well as how it affects people in a socio-economical, psychological and biological way by touching about circadian rhythms and time perception.</p>
      <p>Please come along for a nice drink in Establishment bar and a chat about a very vital topic!</p>
