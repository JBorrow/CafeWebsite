	<h1> Science tug-of-war and the Hippocratic Oath </h1> <br> <h3>27 April 2013</h3>
	

      <p>This Saturday Caf√© Scientifique will present two interesting science-based activities that borrow ideas gained from our members. One that explores funding distribution for as many different areas as possible and one regarding the idea of a Hippocratic Oath for scientists.</p>
      <p>In the first activity, we're going to hear a bit about some burning topics from all areas of science that scientists are working on today. We're then going to brainstorm as a group to decide which we would fund (with a set amount of money) and why.</p>
      <p>The second will be a discussion about how to create some sort of ethical code of conduct for scientists, akin the Hippocratic Oath - an ancient medical document made by Hippocrates to encourage ethical practice by physicians. We will try to make one inspired by modern versions of this oath that could work for sciences, exploring whether these would work cross-sciences.</p>
      <p>We hope you'll join us this week, both to find out about and contribute some fascinating and topical science and also to debate a really interesting and deep topic over a delicious drink by our hosts Establishment Durham.</p>
