	<h1> Grand unification and strings </h1> <br> <h3>02 February 2013</h3>
	<p>Quantum Theory and General Relativity comprise the two major paradigms of modern theoretical physics: general relativity describing large scale, high-energy phenomena and quantum theory describing microscopic, low-energy phenomena. However, the two theories are fundamentally incompatible and attempts at their unification run into difficulties. Alex Peach, from the Physics Department, will discuss the features of general relativity and quantum theory that give rise to the difficulties faced in attempts to unite them - including string theory and how it is used as a unifying theory of these forces.</p>

<p>This will be followed by Alex and Chas Nelson leading a discussion/group activity on science funding, examining the problem from the perspective of what the current funding policy is (the 'Big 8'), what we feel as laypersons should be done and how funding routes should be decided. You don't have to know anything about funding to join in as for two of the groups we are looking for ideas, not previous knowledge: all opinions welcome.</p>

<p>As always, do enjoy a drink from Establishment bar as delving into some compelling science!</p>
