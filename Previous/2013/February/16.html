	<h1> Vision: Attention and consciousness </h1> <br> <h3>16 February 2013</h3>
	
﻿ 
    <p>This week, Café Scientifique will be inviting Bob Kentridge of the Psychology Department to speak about his very exciting work on visual perception: specifically on questions on attention and awareness (or consciousness) and the relationship between the two. Our brain interprets visual information and transforms it into a percept that appears to make sense of the environment, yet in this process a colossal amount of information is lost. Yet, this Café will reveal that there is in fact a great deal of visual information that we process but we are not consciously aware of - we can even use this unconscious information to affect our decisions and processing.</p>
    <p>As Bob has been my supervisor for a couple of years, I am very confident that the two of us will do well in introducing and discussing the topic of visual awareness, to the extent that we will try a new style of Café this week: We will open with a discussion on attention and consciousness and how these areas are perceived by laymen, philosophers, other sciences and even differing opinions within psychology, as introduced by psychology pros Bob, Bobby Innes and myself before coming back to a main talk in the second half.</p>
    <p>We have been excited to give this Café for a while so we know everyone who comes will really engage with the topic and idea. Come along to Establishment and drink while discussing and learning about some cool science!</p>
