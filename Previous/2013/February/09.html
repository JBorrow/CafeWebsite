	<h1> Rubik's cubes and science cross-overs </h1> <br> <h3>09 February 2013</h3>
	<p>This week's Café should be a very fun, informal one by James Blowey, reader in Mathematics and head of Natural Sciences at Durham, who happens to have a bit of a penchant for Rubik's Cubes. The main talk will be on some of the mathematics, art and culture surrounding the Rubik’s Cube. The talk will give an insight on how this can be used to develop group theory, problem-solving and some elementary proof as well as how this relates to the sciences of course! There will also be an opportunity for everyone to make some art and discover mathematics using Rubik's Cubes.</p>

<p>After this, we will have a discussion on crossing disciplines in natural sciences, meaning the discussion will encompass all sciences and how they relate to each other, and this should relate to how the Natural Sciences course itself could be improved, something James Blowey would really benefit from hearing about. To precede this a enjoyable task will involve making a 'sciences map' based on this: <a href="http://xkcd.com/435/">http://xkcd.com/435/</a></p>

<p>As always, do enjoy a drink from Establishment bar whilst delving into some diverse science!</p>
