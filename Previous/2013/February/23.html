	<h1> Philosophical perspectives on science </h1> <br> <h3>23 February 2013</h3>
	

      <p>Hello everyone, this week we will have an informal activity and discussion exploring the relevance of Philosophy as an academic entity and logical standpoint to scientific investigation and theories.</p>
      <p>From his academic Philosophy background, Freddie Ligertwood will introduce the Café with some of the main points of interest in the field and how they are related to science, such as Hume's problem of induction, the completeness of physics and the use of philosophy techniques for analysis of problems, before we then proceed to apply these to our thoughts on science areas or, conversely, criticise the ideologies themselves. This will explore issues of thinking styles and faith, as well as interpretation of data and publications. Freddie and I hope to generate a considered perspective whereby we look at scientific issues from both philosophical and scientific standpoints, and show that it is rarely the case that one method is more superior, but merely a different approach to a problem both intellectuals are seeking an elaboration on.</p>
      <p>We then hope to create a discussion I've wanted to do for a while which is imagination in science - I have finally found a relevant time as it relates strongly to both philosophy and mathematics, the idea that the brain may need to change its instinctive thinking style to accommodate our study and understanding of science. This becomes a psychological, philosophical, theoretical and mathematical question all at once, and may explore our limitations as 'beings not designed to do science'.</p>
      <p>On that controversial note, We hope to debate with you at our quirky mid-term Café over a drink from Establishment bar!</p>
