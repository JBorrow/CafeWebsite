          Echolocation&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3>19 January 2013</h3>
	
          <p>In our second Caf√© of the second series we are proud to have Dr
          Lore Thaler from Psychology to give us a talk on her echolocation
          work - how blind people (and animals!) are able using vocal clicks
          and a deep understanding of echoes and vibrations to navigate around
          rooms and understand the spatial layout of novel environments. This
          will include some very entertaining demonstrations that you can try
          out for yourself!</p>

          <p>Lore's work will educate all of us on how powerful our auditory
          system exactly is, and how the human brain (which devotes a quarter
          of its structure to visual processing) can reorganise itself in light
          of both neurological and physical defects. Personally, I was very
          excited talking to Lore as I heard there even exists auditory video
          games such as flight simulators - such is the extent the blind can
          re-adjust in a primarily sighted world.</p>

          <p>There will be also an exciting, related science discussion which
          should as usual open up the floor for a broad range of science
          interested attendees to speak up and share their own thoughts. All
          are welcome to come along, particularly if you have yet to before.
          Please join us, engage with the talk/discussion and buy a drink from
          our lovely hosts Establishment bar!</p>
