	<h1> GM crops: A strategy to
          feed the world? </h1> <br> <h3>26 January 2013</h3>
	
          <p>This week at Caf√© Scientifique Durham City, we are happy to have
          two plant scientists from the Biology department, Freya Varden and
          Ali Poll, speaking about their work and thoughts on genetically
          modified (GM) crops - a controversial topic which has enormously
          important applications in feeding our ever-growing population. Freya
          and Ali will be explaining some of the facts and dispelling myths
          about genetic modification and the following discussion will allow
          everyone to consider their own views and weigh up the future of this
          hotly debated issue and what benefits it may have for mankind.</p>

          <p>We realise this may be an area many are unknowing of (myself
          definitely included!), but after talking to Freya and Ali, I can
          assure you their clarity will be something all can engage in and
          plant science is an area of science of great importance for all to
          consider. Do come along and learn something new, and buy a drink from
          Establishment bar while you're at it!</p>
