	<h1> Neuroscience of rhythm and music </h1> <br> <h3>15 June 2013</h3>
	

<p>Here's a description by Jamal Kinsella, our speaker this week:</p><blockquote><p>
      "Hello there everyone, due to complications with various speakers like last week, Café Scientifique returns with a relaxed Café hosted by myself, where I draw upon my research in Munich on spatial orientation perception of head movements in the field of computational neuroscience and apply my findings to the field of rhythm in neuroscience generally, and talk about some of the most exciting findings and theories in the field. I will also hopefully relate this to motor control and time perception, which are big research interests of mine.
</p><p>
We will then have a second activity which will subtract my obsessions a little by focusing on music and sound more generally, which should encompass engineering, physics and biological systems, as well as how this influences culture and society more generally.
</p><p>
Come along to Establishment Durham and enjoy an informal chat over delicious drinkies."</p></blockquote>
