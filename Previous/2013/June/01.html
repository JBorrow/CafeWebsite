	<h1> Artificial body parts &amp; comedy </h1> <br> <h3>01 June 2013</h3>
	

      <p>Caf√© Scientifique will return with a guest from outside of Durham, clinical scientist from the NHS Iain Woodrow, who will look at the science and medicine behind the scare stories that were published in the Mail and Express about metal-on-metal joint implants and silicone breast implants. Iain will look at the true toxic effects (or lack of them) of the metals and silicon compounds involved and try to draw out discussion on the ethics behind using these prostheses, which are potentially harmful, in people.</p>
      <p>In a second activity, we'll be having a discussion on this topic and also on the interesting area of scientific comedy and alternative ways to communicate science. Come along for a drink with the lovely Establishment!</p>
