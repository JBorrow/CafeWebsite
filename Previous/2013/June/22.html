	<h1> Interesting 5-minute talks... </h1> <br> <h3>22 June 2013</h3>
	
<p>
After the success of our first impromptu Café, we decided to host another. This Café Scientifique will be a very informal get-together where attendees, as we did once before, bring something to talk about for five minutes or less - though last time we did very random things, the challenge this time is to relate what you're talking about to science (even the most tangential of relations will be fine)! For example, some ideas I have include the neuroscience of fish and science in video games.</p><p>

There will be time after each person's talk to discuss in more detail, but please get there before 3pm so I can put together a first-come first-serve order of the talks. Alternatively, feel free to message me what you'd like to talk about. Pro tip: Perhaps bring something to talk about that people may not know, or where people may have some misconception your thinking can debunk!
</p><p>
As always, this tends to lead to an interesting chat about unexpected things. Really looking forward to chatting to you all over delicious Establishment Durham cocktails!</p>
