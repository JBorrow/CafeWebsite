	<h1> Energy from water: New molecules for sustainable energy </h1> <br> <h3>04 May 2013</h3>
	

      <p>This week, Corinna Hess from the Chemistry Department will be talking to us about progress towards sustainable energy involving water-splitting.</p>
      <p>The predictions that fossil fuels can no longer sustain the energy hunger of a growing population demands new energy technologies to mitigate the consequences for our environment, economy and global security. Hydrogen presents an ideal alternative to fossil fuels: its benefits include a high energy density by mass and emission-free consumption.</p>
      <p>Significantly, recent research has demonstrated that hydrogen can be produced from two abundant resources, namely sunlight and water, via a process that mimics photosynthesis. Corinna will briefly present some of the underlying scientific principles of an ‘artificial photosystem’ and hydrogen production via this process, and discuss the advancements in chemistry that are required to make this technology viable.</p>
      <p>We will also, with the help of Catherine, be discussing some other up-and-coming energy ideas from many different areas of science, including one idea that suggests cheap solar cells can be made from Spinach and Toothpaste...</p>
      <p>Take a break and come down for some relaxed, informal discussion at Cafe Scientifique Durham City with a drink from the lovely Establishment!</p>
