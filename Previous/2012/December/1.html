	<h1> Sustainable energy
          double bill</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3> 1 December 2012</h3>
	
          <p>Café Scientifique for the next two weeks will be of a slightly
          different format from usual... this is the first week of our
          SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FORTNIGHT to send off the year with. This more
          experimental Café has planned for a long time so please come along
          and bring your friends! We're very excited to try this new style of
          scientific engagement.</p>

          <p>In week 1, *two* academics will tell us about their research into
          their distinct fields.</p>

          <p>In week 2, the focus is on participation and discussion, having
          been inspired by the academics in week 1. We will discuss the
          viability of many current sustainable energy schemes and future
          ideas, and pool and discuss *our own* ideas.</p>

          <p>To begin, this week Dr Douglas Halliday from the Physics
          Department will talk about his work on thin film and solar cells
          along with Professor Keith Lindsey who will look at the sustainable
          energy topic from a more bio- perspective with reference to biofuels
          (fuels made from plant sources).</p>

          <p>We hope the first week will serve to inform yourselves and us
          about a topic where no one has all the right answers, and in the
          following week we will try to create a amalgamation of our ideas from
          various displines.</p>

          <p>We hope week 2 will be one of our most relaxed Cafés to date, with
          no real speaker, as opposed to the interesting ideas discussed by our
          two speakers in the previous week. New and unique ideas presented by
          all are encouraged and multiple perspectives will be necessary to
          generate a great discussion of issues regarding sustainable energy in
          both science and society. In doing so, we will review some of the
          research which is taking place right now at Durham University.</p>
