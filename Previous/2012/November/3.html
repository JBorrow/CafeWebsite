	<h1> Brain-machine
          interactions</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3> 3 November 2012</h3>
	
          <p>Following Hallowe'en, we have a 'scary' Caf√© about.....
          Brain-machine interactions (brrr!)! In seriousness, this week we have
          a new lecturer from the Psychology Department, Dr Jason Connolly,
          talking about his research on how the brain can come to understand
          machine-interfaces on a sensory processing level, and this will feed
          in very well to a discussion about prosthetics as hosted by him and
          myself, after receiving information from a close friend who studies
          the field (who unfortunately we could not fly from Berlin).</p>

          <p>I find both topics incredibly exciting research areas from
          biological, psychological and computer science points of view. I hope
          everyone can come along and contribute with their ideas in the
          discussion, and get something really valuable from the talk, which
          should give us the tools of thought to understand how prosthetics and
          other forms of augmentation work.</p>
