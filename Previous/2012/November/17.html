	<h1> Stem cells
          today</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3>17 November 2012</h3>
	
          <p>This week's Caf√© Scientifique will have a talk and discussion by
          Dr Nick Hole from the Biology Department. Nick had been studying stem
          cells for over twenty years with strong experience in hematopoietic
          (blood) stem cells. Nick will talk on the subject of umbilical cord
          stem cells: what they are, how they can be useful and their
          advantages over other stem cell sources. This will hopefully provide
          everybody with an introduction to umbilical cord stem cells and an
          idea of some stem cell stem cell therapies.</p>

          <p>This will be followed by a short discussion on Stem Cell Banks
          where we will think about the pros and cons of public and private
          stem cell banks from the point of view of parents, doctors, private
          companies and the NHS.As a result, the discussion will be something
          all should be able to engage with and teach us the valuable skill of
          considering (scientific) issues from a number of perspectives.</p>
