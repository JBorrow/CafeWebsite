	<h1> Science and the
          media</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3>24 November 2012</h3>
	
          <p>We now have more choice than ever on how to consume our media and
          the mainstream news organisations are undergoing their most radical
          change in their 300 year history. Social media has added a massive
          amount of noise and accessibility to our already busy lives. How does
          science make the biggest impact it can in the current landscape and
          why should it bother?</p>

          <p>This Café Scientifique will feature a talk and discussion as
          hosted by Institute of Physics journalist Naz Kinsella as he talks
          about how science and media (including social media) affect one
          another and how best to communicate scientific ideals in our brave
          new world. Please join us for this particularly unusual style Café
          that explores important questions that cannot be explored in science
          degrees and textbooks, where every perspective and contribution is
          valid and unique.</p>
