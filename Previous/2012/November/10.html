	<h1> Scientific engagement (with
          meerkats!)</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3>10 November 2012</h3>
	
          <p>This week Caf√© Scientifique will host a very unique style of talk
          by Dr Matt Candea from the anthropology department who studies
          scientists and how they engage with their work - specifically the
          meerkats studied by behavioural ecologists in the southern Kalahari.
          The perspective of the scientists, however, is very different from
          that of some of the non-science communicators (makers of the
          docu-soap 'Meerkat Manor' and people who enjoy the show), and Matt
          will speak about what makes the scientific perspective towards
          animals unique.</p>

          <p>This will be followed by a discussion about engagement and
          attachment in all sciences -- to what level is it appropriate for
          scientists/non-scientists to engage with the scientific phenomena
          being observed? How has science been affected in the past by such
          high levels of engagement? Following the observations of Matt, we
          should be able to generate an informed and unique discussion here
          from many scientists and non-scientists alike.</p>
