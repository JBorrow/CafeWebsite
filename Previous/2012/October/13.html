	<h1> The future of 3D
          technology</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3>13 October 2012</h3>
	
          <p>The second Café of the series is on 3D technology, marking the
          first time we have hada member of the Engineering and Computing
          Sciences department speaking at Café Scientifique in Nick Holliman
          who looks into stereoscopic 3D technology.</p>

          <p>There will be a demonstration on 3D technology, with a 3D screen
          and enough 3D glasses for everyone to use. We will talk also about
          what advancements are likely in the future of this technology and
          what the implications are of this. Please come along for a nice,
          informal scientific discussion as always, and as usual the
          perspective of all, scientists/non-scientists of every department and
          anyone else.</p>
