	<h1> Scientific perspective of
          hallucinations</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3>06 October 2012</h3>
	
          <p>The first activity of Caf√© Scientifique of this series will be a
          talk focused on the science of hallucinations by David Smailes. His
          work focuses on the effect of social isolation on hallucinations, and
          how hallucinations may not simply be a sign of mental health
          problems. This will be followed by an informal discussion on the
          topic.</p>

          <p>The second activity will be an engaging task for everyone about
          how to think about scientific issues. Tim and I spent a while
          planning this and we are hopeful it will be fun, friendly and
          thought-provoking.</p>
