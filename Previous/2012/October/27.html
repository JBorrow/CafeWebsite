	<h1> The story of the double
          helix</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3>27 October 2012</h3>
	
          <p>Chas Nelson from the Biology department will be talking this week
          about the double helix and the story of how understanding of the
          structure in DNA came about this week from both a physics and biology
          background and understanding. This should generate some ideas about
          the following discussion of women in science which will encourage
          scientists and non-scientists alike to consider issues in science
          from their own unique perspectives, as initiated by Chas and also
          Freya Varden, who has much experience in this area as a scientist and
          a female human being.</p>

          <p>We hope to really engage people this week by first presenting
          people the tools they can use for discussion and then in the second
          half presenting an topic that can be thought of from multiple
          perspectives.</p>
