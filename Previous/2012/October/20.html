	<h1> The chemistry of
          light</p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</h1> <br> <h3>20 October 2012</h3>
	
          <p>This week Café Scientifique will host Professor Andrew Beeby as he
          talks about how light works and how his photochemistry research and
          how it relates to many other sciences and technology, such as digital
          screens and medicine. Through conversations with Andrew, I know he
          has the rare talent of communicating the difficult area of chemistry
          in a readily-understandable way. As such, I encourage all to attend
          with even a passing interest - the invaluable gift Café Scientifique
          offers to each of its unique friends is the chance to understand and
          contribute to discussions about scientific issues.</p>

          <p>As usual there will be a lighter second half giving us the chance,
          along with the break, to continue to discuss science in a friendly
          and all-inclusive way.</p>
