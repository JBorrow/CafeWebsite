<h2>6th December 2014</h2>

<p>Prof. Chris Done will be giving a public-based talk about Quantum Mechanics.
No, you don't need a PhD in Physics to come along - this is aimed at anyone
who's interested in the funky ways atoms work!</p>

<p>Abstract to come...</p>

<p>We are
    looking forward to seeing you there at the usual time of 3:45 pm in Empty Shop!
    If you're unsure how to get there, please take a look at our

    a blackboard outside at 3:30 to guide you in!</p>
