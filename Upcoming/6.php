<h2>6th December 2014</h2>

<p>Prof. Chris Done will be giving a public-based talk about black holes.
No, you don't need a PhD in Physics to come along - this is aimed at anyone
who's interested in the funky gravity works!</p>

<p>Abstract to come...</p>

<p>We are
    looking forward to seeing you there at the usual time of 3:45 pm in Empty Shop!
    If you're unsure how to get there, please take a look at our
    <a href="index.php">homepage</a> where there is a map. On the day, we will put
    a blackboard outside at 3:30 to guide you in!</p>
