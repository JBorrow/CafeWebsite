<h2>18th October 2014</h2>

<p>Professor Carlos Frenk from the Institute for Computational Cosmology will
be giving a talk on Dark Matter and Dark Energy at this upcoming Cafe. He may
also be talking about computational cosmology, and, in particular,
<a href = "http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle">The EAGLE Project</a> - the most recent
simulation that has been performed on the Durham supercomputer.</p>

<p>Here's the abstract for his talk: </p>

<blockquote>
Cosmology confronts some of the most fundamental questions in the
whole of science. How and when did our universe begin? What is it made
of?  How did galaxies and other structures form?  There has been
enormous progress in the past few decades towards answering these
questions. For example, recent observations have established that our
universe contains an unexpected mix of components: ordinary atoms,
exotic dark matter and a new form of energy called dark energy.
Gigantic surveys of galaxies reveal how the universe is structured.
Large supercomputer simulations recreate the evolution of the universe
and provide the means to relate processes occuring near the beginning
with observations of the universe today. A coherent picture of cosmic
evolution, going back to a tiny fraction of a second after the Big
Bang, is beginning to emerge. However, fundamental issues, like the
identity of the dark matter and the nature of the dark energy, remain
unresolved.
</blockquote>

<p>As always, we will be meeting at the Empty Shop, which is located just
outside the enterance to The Gates Shopping Centre. The doors will open at 3:45
pm and the talk will start at 4:00 pm. See you there for some fun science and
what will be a very interesting talk from a lead figure in the field!</p>
