<h2>13th December 2014</h2>

Hi everyone, this week we will be going to a restaurant rather than meeting in Empty Shop, swapping
our caffine for carbohydrates! If you're interested in coming, please e-mail me below before the
1st December so we can book the table. As for a choice of restaurant, we'll probably be going to
Tia's - a little tex-mex place in the center of town.

<p>Thanks!</p>
