<h2>8th November 2014</h2>

<p>To coincide with the
    <a href="http://www.iomp.org/idmp/">International day of Medical Physics</a>
    on the 7th November, we will be hosting Gemma Roberts who is a Radiologist
    in the NHS.</p>

<p>The talk we be on using radioactivity to diagnose disease.  Weâ€™ll talk about
    how we make radioactive tracers, how the gamma camera (scanner) works and the
    types of scan we can do.</p>

<p>This will be an interesting one, and will be the first time we've allowed a
    projector into the Empty Shop - this is because the talk is very visually
    oriented.</p>

<p>We are
    looking forward to seeing you there at the usual time of 3:45 pm in Empty Shop!
    If you're unsure how to get there, please take a look at our
    <a href="index.php">homepage</a> where there is a map. On the day, we will put
    a blackboard outside at 3:30 to guide you in!</p>
