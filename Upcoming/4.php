<h2>22nd November 2014</h2>

<p>Dr. James Blowey, the director of Natural Sciences at Durham University, will
be giving a talk on Rubik's cube. He will aim to answer such philisophical
questions such as "Why do the media find Rubik's cube fascinating?".</p>

<p>James has a sizeable collection of Rubik's cubes, and it could be said that
he's a collector. Come along to learn something new about these fantastic
puzzles!</p>

<p>We are
    looking forward to seeing you there at the usual time of 3:45 pm in Empty Shop!
	    If you're unsure how to get there, please take a look at our
		    <a href="index.php">homepage</a> where there is a map. On the day, we will put
			    a blackboard outside at 3:30 to guide you in!</p>
