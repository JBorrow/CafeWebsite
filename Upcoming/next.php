<h2>11th October 2014</h2>

<p>This week, Carrie Ambler from the biology department here in Durham will give
a talk on the cellular nature of skin and regeneration. Afterwards, there will
be an informal discussion on science news that has occurred over the summer.</p>

<p>As always, we will be meeting in the Empty Shop, which is just outside The
Gates Shopping Centre. There will be a board outside so you know where you are
going! The 'doors' will open at 3:45 pm and the talk will be starting at 4:00
pm. See you there!</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome at Cafe Scientifique - be you a student, a member of
staff from the University or just a member of the public with an interest in
science! See you there for a fun and intersting talk!</p>
